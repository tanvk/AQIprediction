# Air Quality Forecasting & Visualization

A Python-based project for analyzing and forecasting air quality metrics using real-world datasets. 
This repository contains modular Python scripts, datasets, and HTML outputs for visualization 
of air quality trends across different sources.

## 📊 Features
- Data analysis of multiple environmental datasets (CSV format)
- Forecasting models for air quality metrics
- Visualization scripts for bar charts and scatter plots
- HTML dashboards for interpretability of results
- Modular Python scripts for reusable workflows

## 📂 Project Structure
```
.
├── app.py                # Main application script
├── aqi.py                # AQI-related computations
├── *_bar.py              # Bar chart plotting scripts
├── *_scatter.py          # Scatter plot plotting scripts
├── *.csv                 # Air quality datasets
├── forecast.html         # Forecast output (interactive)
├── try.html              # Additional visualization output
```

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/air-quality-forecasting.git
cd air-quality-forecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Create a `requirements.txt` with necessary packages, e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`.)*

## ▶️ Usage
Run the main application:
```bash
python app.py
```

This will execute the workflow for reading datasets, processing air quality metrics, 
and generating output plots and dashboards.

## 📈 Example Outputs
- **Forecasts:** Interactive plots in `forecast.html`
- **Visualizations:** Bar and scatter plots per dataset
